XGBoost Documentation
=====================
This is document of xgboost library.
XGBoost is short for eXtreme gradient boosting. This is a library that is designed, and optimized for boosted (tree) algorithms.
The goal of this library is to push the extreme of the computation limits of machines to provide a ***scalable***, ***portable*** and ***accurate***
for large scale tree boosting.
